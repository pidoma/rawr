<h1>What's a Bucket List?</h1>
<p>
If you haven’t heard about the bucket list, it is a list of all the goals you want to achieve, dreams you want to fulfill and life-experiences you desire to experience before you die.
</p>
<br>
<h1>Why create a Bucket List?</h1>
<p>If you don’t live your days by personal goals and plans, chances are you spend most of your time caught up in a flurry of day-to-day activities. Ever feel your days are passing by without any tangible output to speak of? What were your accomplishments in the past 3 months? What are your upcoming goals for the next 3 months? Look at the things you did and the things you’re planning to do next – Do they mean anything to you if you are to die today? Having a bucket list reminds you of what’s really important so you can act on them.
<br>
Even if you frequently live by goals or to-do lists, they are probably framed within a certain social context e.g., performance, career, health. A bucket list opens up the context. It’s a forum to set anything and everything you’ve ever wanted to do, whether it’s big, small or random.
<br>
<b>It’s just like planning ahead all the highlights you want for YOUR whole life.</b></p>
